# RECURSION VS ITERATION

### ITERATION
Iteration mean the repetition of the process. In javascript , Iterations
statement usually come from : 

- For statement 
- For In statement
- For Of statement
- While statement
- Doâ€¦While statement
- forEach()
- filter()
- map()
- reduce()



# 
### RECURSION
Recursion is a programming technique that using
fuction that call itself one or more times until a 
specified condition is met.
 
# 
### DIFFERENCE RECURSION & ITERATION
- Recursion termination through base case, where there will be no function call.For Iteration when the termination condition for the iterator ceases to be satisfied.
- Recursion used when code size needs to be small, and time complexity is not an issue. For iteration ,used when time complexity needs to be balanced against an expanded code size.
- Recursion need smaller code size . For iteration need Larger code size
- Recursion time complexitiy are very high(generally exponential) time complexity.For iteration time complexitiy relatively lower time complexity(generally polynomial-logarithmic).
