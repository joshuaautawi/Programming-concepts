# Synchronous & Asynchronous in Javascript

Synchronous means execute code in sequence , so each stament wait the previous statement to finish and  Asynchronous means  execute code without waiting for the previous one to finish.

In short , synchronous means "wait for me to finish before doing something else " and asynchronous means " It's ok , keep going while i finishing it". And threaded 
is more about how many block of code i can run simultaneously. Thread more to quantity , and sync more to how to code execute.

You wouldn't use async for everthing , this can to less performance and complex code.
Use asycn when you performing expensive and time-consuming operation.
